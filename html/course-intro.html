                        <p>In this course, you'll learn how to automate the infrastructure and deployment pipelines using AWS services and tools so if you're some type of software or DevOps-focused engineer or architect interested in learning how to use AWS Developer Tools to create a full-lifecycle software delivery solution, it's the course for you. The focus of the course is on deployment pipeline architectures and its implementations and not on software architectures.</p>

                       <p>The DevOps Essentials on AWS course has a heavy focus on the use of AWS Developer Tools and other services, notably: </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> - a tool you can use to automate the provisioning of AWS resources</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodePipeline</strong> - which provides the capability to orchestrate your software delivery workflows</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeCommit</strong> - a Git-based version-control repository</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeBuild</strong> - a fully-managed service for running automated builds, tests, and static analysis</li>
                            <li><strong>AWS CodeDeploy</strong> - a fully-managed service for deploying software to environments</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>AWS CodePipeline is the primary tool used in <strong>all</strong> the examples of this course. All of the solutions are automated via AWS CloudFormation. There are seven examples that use many of the AWS Developer Tools. All of the examples are available from a GitHub repository that will be referenced throughout this course. All of the examples are based on the static website that you're viewing now and will be used to walk you through the sample solutions. The seven example solutions are: </p>
                        <ul class="edited-ul">
                            <li>Static Website (i.e., AWS S3 hosted)</li>
                            <li>AWS EC2 (traditional EC2 deployment with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy on EC2 instances)</li>
                            <li>AWS OpsWorks</li>
                            <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</li>
                            <li>Amazon ECS</li>
                            <li>Serverless (AWS Lambda, etc.)</li>
                            <li>AWS CodeStar</li>
                        </ul>


                    <p>While you can use the course website to deploy the solutions without watching the video, you'll find it's much easier seeing me walk through the steps in the course. The course website is located at <strong><a href="http://www.devopsessentialsaws.com/">http://devopsessentialsaws.com</a></strong>.</p>

                    <p>If you launch all of the sample solutions and then terminate the resources after one day, you will spend less than $15 on AWS fees for the use of the AWS services.</p>

                    <p>As you navigate through the lessons, I increase the complexity by adding additional stages, actions, databases, and services into the static website solution. While the course predominantly uses AWS tools, there will be <em>some</em> third-party integrations and open-source tools incorporated into the examples. You can fork the GitHub repository to make your own changes.</p>

                    <p>In Section 1, you will be able to describe the basic components and tools of a deployment pipeline, describe DevOps, describe patterns of effective culture, learn team organization patterns, and the basics of establishing Continuous Delivery to deliver software on demand.</p>

                    <p>In Section 2, you will configure the course prerequisites on your computer, manually provision the static website, describe how to orchestrate software workflows in CodePipeline, store software assets in CodeCommit, Build and test software in CodeBuild, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate solution in CodePipeline.</p>

                    <p>In Section 3, you will describe the basic features of EC2, describe how to deploy applications using CodeDeploy, describe the architecture and launch the sample solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate the EC2-based solution in CodePipeline.</p>

                     <p>In Section 4, you will describe the basic features of OpsWorks, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate the solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Section 5, you will describe the basic features of Elastic Beanstalk, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Section 6, you will describe the basic features of EC2 Container Service (ECS), Describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Section 7, you will describe the basic features of Serverless, describe the Serverless Application Model, describe the architecture and launch the solution, provision AWS resources in CloudFormation, and orchestrate solution in CodePipeline</p>

                     <p>In Section 8, you will launch the solution from a CodeStar Project Template, configure the dashboard for the project, manage code changes, deploy software, orchestrate software using Pipeline, manage team members, and extend solution using Extensions.</p>
