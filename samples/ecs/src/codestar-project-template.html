                        <p>Project templates are pre-existing solution stacks that include a development platform, an application type, and an AWS service on which the application will deployed. At the time of this recording, there are over 30 project templates provided by CodeStar and I fully expect that AWS will only add to the existing set of project templates. </p>
                         <p>The sample project template we're going to use is an Express.js web application running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In another sublesson and after you generate the pre-packaged solution using CodeStar, you'll copy the <strong>html</strong> files from <a href="https://github.com/stelligent/devops-essentials">devops-essentials</a> GitHub repository to the CodeCommit repository generated by the CodeStar project template. Keep in mind that we could choose to use any of the CodeStar project templates to run the course website so the important point I will demonstrate is how you can make changes to the sample solutions provided by AWS.</p>
