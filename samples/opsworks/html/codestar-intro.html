                        <p>In this lesson you learn about AWS CodeStar. CodeStar is essentially an aggregation service that helps you easily configure and manage the full deployment stacks so that you can quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. It uses many existing AWS services such as CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, IAM, and CloudWatch. It also includes a wiki, interfaces to development tools, and extensions to third-party tools.</p>
